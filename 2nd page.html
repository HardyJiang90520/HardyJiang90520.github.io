<h1>One Thing that I Like</h1>
		<p>Okay, therefore this is a new link about one thing that I like. When you finished reading this page, you can click the "return" button that`s in the bottom of this page.&nbsp; :) </p>
	<h2>The RC Airplanes</h2>
		<p>One thing that I like is the RC airplanes. In RC airplanes, we use transmitters to control the airplanes. The transmitter we usually use is a type of special transmitter that send something like pwm signals in 2.4G. Also, we use a special type of receivers as well. The RC airplanes are using servos to control the direction of there the RC airplanes fly and use brushless motors to control the speed of the RC airplanes. The reason why I like RC airplanes is because you can enjoy the freedom like a bird in the sky. Seriously, I think I`m still an beginner of the RC airplanes.&nbsp; :/</p>
