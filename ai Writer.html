	<p>Feedback: So, I just selected a "sad" tone, "a silent star night" as the topic and "me, nature, tree, alone, forest, the end of a story" as some imformation about the topic. And then, the result has appeared on the right side of the image. I think the AI writer has done very well on describing the atmosphere and the mood of the writing. However, I think the AI writer still lack a bit of humanity.</p>

	<p>Feedback: In this AI writer's writing, I can see that this writing is very creative, and it can create many interesting stories that you might not expect. But also this AI writer can't write so long, which means it can only write a few.</p>
